[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/6854cbe0-2f62-4162-ab35-462dfd71c603/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/kareenapatel-colourinputdisplayer/deploys)

## ‚å®Ô∏è Tech stack 
HTML / CSS / React / npm / Node.js / Cypress (Testing)

## üçº Introduction
Updating arrays in state is a concept I had little practice in in React. Therefore I created a colour input displayer as a mini project to recap the concept. This application enables the user to enter a hex code which will be displayed in a list. However each code entered will have the background colour of that hex code. The user can delete any items and any time and the order of items will be retained. 

## üõ†Ô∏è Features
- Regex used to validate input against rules
    - Is a length of 3 or 6
    - Contains the accepted characters (0-9, a-f, A-F)
- Able to add a colour to the list
- Able to delete any colour in any place in the list
- Colour entered becomes the background colour of the listed item with the hex value displayed.
- Allows duplicate colours to be displayed and deleted independently (through an id prop)
- Implemented accessibility throughout application
- Additional branch called 'testing' for unit tests and component tests
